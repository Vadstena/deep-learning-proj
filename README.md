# Deep Learning project
This project consists of two homework assignments, each containing both theoretical questions and practical implementation of deep learning models. 

Homework 1 involves medical image classification using:

- linear classifiers and neural networks (NNs): perceptron, logistic regression (using SGD), multi-layer perceptron (implemented by hand)
- linear model with logistic regression and a feed-forward NN using an automatic differentiation toolkit

more details can be found in the [project statement](HW1/hw1_description.pdf).

Homework 2 also involves image classification, however, using convolutional neural networks instead. As well as Automatic Speech Recognition (incomplete). Homework details found in the respective [project statement](HW2/hw2_description.pdf).
